Embeddium is a free and open-source performance mod for Minecraft clients. It is based on the last FOSS-licensed version of the Sodium codebase, and includes additional bugfixes & features for better mod compatibility.

Despite being forked from Sodium, Embeddium is **not supported by CaffeineMC**. Do not report issues encountered with it to their bug tracker or in their Discord - please open an issue on our [Issues page](https://github.com/FiniteReality/embeddium).

## Highlights

* All performance improvements from Sodium 0.5.8 and earlier, i.e. a rewritten terrain renderer, various optimizations to the immediate-mode rendering pipeline (used by entities, GUIs, block entities, etc.), and other miscellaneous improvements
* Available for Minecraft Forge on 1.20.1 and older, and Fabric/NeoForge on 1.20.1 and newer
* Integrated Fabric Rendering API support (Indium is no longer required, and will not work with Embeddium)
* Frequent patch updates to fix mod compatibility issues soon after being reported & reproduced
* Additional APIs for mod integration
* Optional support for translucency sorting (can be enabled in Video Settings)

## For developers

If you're looking to add Embeddium to your development environment, please take a look at the [dedicated wiki page](https://github.com/FiniteReality/embeddium/wiki/For-Developers) for instructions & recommended guidelines for integration.
